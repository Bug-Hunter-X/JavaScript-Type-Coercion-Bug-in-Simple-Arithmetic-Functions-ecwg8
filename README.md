This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in JavaScript related to type coercion in arithmetic operations.  The `add` and `subtract` functions work as expected when provided numerical arguments, but unexpected behavior occurs when strings are passed. The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version that explicitly handles type checking and coercion to prevent the bug.  This example highlights the importance of robust type handling in JavaScript to avoid runtime errors and unexpected results.
